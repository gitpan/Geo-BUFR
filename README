DESCRIPTION

BUFR = Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological
data. BUFR is becoming the standard exchange format for meteorological
observations. This module provides methods for decoding and encoding
BUFR messages, and for displaying information in BUFR B and D tables
and in BUFR flag and code tables. The core routines for encoding and
decoding bitstreams are implemented in C.

This module also installs some example programs: bufrread.pl,
bufrresolve.pl, bufrencode.pl, bufr_reencode.pl and bufralter.pl. See
https://wiki.met.no/bufr.pm/start for examples of use.

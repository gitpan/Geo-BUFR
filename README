DESCRIPTION

BUFR = Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological
data. BUFR is becoming the standard exchange format for meteorological
data. This module provides methods for decoding and encoding BUFR
messages, and for displaying information in BUFR B and D tables and in
BUFR flag and code tables. The core routines for encoding and decoding
bitstreams are implemented in C.

This module also installs some example programs: bufrread.pl,
bufrresolve.pl, bufrencode.pl, bufr_reencode.pl and bufralter.pl. See
https://wiki.met.no/bufr.pm/start for examples of use.

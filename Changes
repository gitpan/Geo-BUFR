Revision history for Perl extension Geo::BUFR.

1.1   2010-04-09

- Resolving of flag values changed to work also for big endian platforms.

- Scaling of values fetched from bitstream has been transfered from
  BUFR.xs to BUFR.pm, resulting in new signature for method
  bitstream2dec. Hopefully this will fix some tiny rounding errors in
  decoding found on some systems.

1.0   2010-04-06

- First release for CPAN.

Revision history for Perl extension Geo::BUFR.

1.24 2013-08-28
- Bugfix in bufrread.pl (when running with --strict_checking 2).
- Strict_checking for (reserved) 0 bits 3-8 in octet 7 in section 3.
- Default tables for utility programs changed to master table version 19.

1.23 2013-05-14
- Supporting data description operators 207Y and 235000.
- Several bugfixes related to bit maps.

1.22 2013-04-03
- Format of ECMWF tables version 15-17 changed slightly from previous
  versions, requiring some changes in processing.
- Added strict checking for value encoded using BUFR compression which
  would be too big to encode without compression.
- Had to change a test script because newer versions of perl might add
  a '.' to end of warning/error messages.

1.21 2012-02-06
- Better recovery from some error conditions (like table D descriptor
  not found).
- Strict_checking for character data not being CCITTIA5.

1.20 2011-03-08
- Supporting delayed repetition (031011,031012)
- Allow total length of BUFR message as stated in section 0 to be
  bigger than actual length (if $Strict_checking not set).
- Strict_checking for null characters in CCITTIA5 data.
- New option --on_error_stop to bufrread.pl.
- copy_from altered to copy also section 2 if copying of metadata is
  requested. Makes bufralter.pl work for messages with optional section.

1.19 2010-11-29
- Bugfix in bufrread.pl --filter
- If local table version is 255, treat this as if it was 0 when
  finding which table to use.

1.18 2010-09-30
- join_subsets altered to always respect order of subsets specified
- encode_nil_message altered to set number of subsets to 1 and data
  compression to 0, saving user from remembering this.

1.17 2010-09-14
- Data description operator 208Y implemented.

1.16 2010-07-21
- Strip trailing nulls from CCITTIA5 data.
- dumpsections() now takes optional argument for controlling width and
  whether bitmapped values are displayed side by side.
- copy() renamed to copy_from().
- Use looks_like_number from Scalar::Util to check that numeric input
  to encoding routines is indeed numeric.

1.15 2010-07-02
- clone() replaced with copy() with somewhat different syntax.
- New methods rewind() and join_subsets().
- Added optional parameter to encode_nil_message() making it possible
  to set delayed replication factors > 1.
- Default tables for utility programs changed to master table version 14.

1.14  2010-05-18
- Apply binmode to filehandle in fopen.
- Added two more methods for extracting info from BUFR B and D tables.

1.13  2010-05-07
- Bugfix in dec2bitstream: could cause rounding errors when encoding
  big width numerical values.

1.12  2010-04-13
- Test script t/bufralter.pl: fixed a quoting bug.

1.11  2010-04-12
- Test scripts: removed shebang line and use Config to find perl path.

1.1   2010-04-09
- Resolving of flag values fixed to work for big endian platforms.
- Scaling of values fetched from bitstream transfered from BUFR.xs
  to BUFR.pm, resulting in new signature for method bitstream2dec.

1.0 2010-04-06
- First release for CPAN.
